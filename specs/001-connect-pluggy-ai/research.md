# Phase 0: Research

This document summarizes the research findings for the "Connect Pluggy.ai with YNAB API" feature.

## Research Topics

1.  **YNAB API Client Library for Node.js**
2.  **Best practices for storing API credentials securely**
3.  **Strategies for preventing duplicate transaction imports**
4.  **Logging libraries for TypeScript/Node.js**

## Findings

### 1. YNAB API Client Library

*   **Decision**: A custom API wrapper will be created.
*   **Rationale**: A search for existing Node.js libraries did not yield a popular or official client. Building a lightweight wrapper around `axios` or `fetch` will provide the necessary functionality without adding a large or unmaintained dependency.
*   **Alternatives considered**: Using a less popular, community-maintained library, which was rejected due to potential maintenance and security concerns.

### 2. Secure Credential Storage

*   **Decision**: Use environment variables with a `.env` file for local development.
*   **Rationale**: This is a standard, secure practice for Node.js applications. The project is already configured with `dotenv` and a `.env.example` file, so this approach aligns with the existing structure. For production, a secret management service would be the recommended approach.
*   **Alternatives considered**: Hardcoding credentials (rejected as insecure), storing in a database (rejected as overly complex for this use case).

### 3. Duplicate Transaction Prevention

*   **Decision**: Use the unique transaction ID from the Pluggy.ai API as an idempotency key.
*   **Rationale**: Each transaction from Pluggy should have a unique identifier. This ID can be stored along with the transaction data when it's imported into the system. Before importing a new transaction, the system will check if a transaction with the same ID has already been processed.
*   **Alternatives considered**: Using a hash of transaction details (more brittle if any detail changes), relying on date/amount/description (not guaranteed to be unique).

### 4. Logging Library

*   **Decision**: Use `pino` for logging.
*   **Rationale**: `pino` is a high-performance logging library that produces structured JSON logs by default. This is ideal for a CLI/API application where logs can be easily parsed and processed by other tools. Its low overhead is a significant advantage.
*   **Alternatives considered**: `winston` is another popular choice, offering more flexibility with transports, but its performance is lower than `pino`'s, and the added flexibility is not a primary requirement for this feature.
