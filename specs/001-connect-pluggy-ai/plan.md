# Implementation Plan: Connect Pluggy.ai with YNAB API

**Branch**: `001-connect-pluggy-ai` | **Date**: 2025-09-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-connect-pluggy-ai/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature will connect Pluggy.ai and YNAB APIs to allow automatic export of banking data. The system will authenticate with both services, fetch transactions from Pluggy, format them, and post them to YNAB, handling potential errors and preventing duplicate entries.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript ^5.0.0
**Primary Dependencies**: pluggy-sdk, vitest, tsx, dotenv, axios, pino
**Storage**: Not specified
**Testing**: vitest
**Target Platform**: Node.js
**Project Type**: Single project (monorepo)
**Performance Goals**: Not specified
**Constraints**: Not specified
**Scale/Scope**: Not specified

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (core, export-ofx)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes, the core logic will be in `@pluggy-ofx-export/core`.
- Libraries listed: `@pluggy-ofx-export/core` (handles Pluggy interaction), `@pluggy-ofx-export/export-ofx` (CLI tool)
- CLI per library: `export-ofx` will be the CLI.
- Library docs: Not yet.

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? To be followed.
- Git commits show tests before implementation? To be followed.
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? To be followed.
- Real dependencies used? To be determined.
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes.
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Will be respected.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Logging library to be used]
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? To be ensured.

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Yes, 0.1.0.
- BUILD increments on every change? To be determined.
- Breaking changes handled? N/A for initial version.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1, with code organized within the existing `packages/*` structure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research YNAB API client library for Node.js.
   - Research best practices for storing API credentials securely.
   - Research strategies for preventing duplicate transaction imports.
   - Research logging libraries for TypeScript/Node.js.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research YNAB API client libraries for Node.js"
   Task: "Find best practices for securely storing API credentials in a Node.js application"
   Task: "Research strategies for preventing duplicate transaction imports between two systems"
   Task: "Evaluate logging libraries for TypeScript/Node.js projects (e.g., pino, winston)"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
