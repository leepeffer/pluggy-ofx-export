# Pluggy OFX Exporter

This project allows you to export transactions from financial institutions in Brazil to OFX files.
It uses the free open finance API from [Pluggy](https://www.pluggy.ai/en).

## Setup

### Pre-requisites

Run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your actual Pluggy API credentials:
```bash
PLUGGY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
PLUGGY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
PLUGGY_ITEM_IDS=item_id_1,item_id_2,item_id_3
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive API credentials that should remain private.

### Export transactions from Pluggy accounts to OFX files

**Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)**
```bash
pnpm run web
```
Then open http://localhost:3001 in your browser for a user-friendly interface.

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
pnpm run export-ofx
```

The web interface provides:
- üé® Modern, intuitive interface
- üìÖ Custom date range selection
- üè¶ Selective account export
- üìù Custom file naming
- üìÅ Choose export location
- üíæ Download as ZIP or individual files

The command line exports the last 3 months of transactions from each account in Pluggy to different OFX files in the `exports/` directory, organized by date.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: Modern, user-friendly interface for easy OFX export
- **Command Line Tool**: Traditional CLI for automated exports
- **OFX Export**: Export transactions to standard OFX format for use with financial software
- **Brazilian Bank Support**: Optimized for Brazilian financial institutions via Pluggy API

- **Transaction Filtering**: Built-in filters for common Brazilian bank transaction patterns
- **Organized Output**: Files are automatically organized by date in the `exports/` directory

## What's Different from the Original

This fork removes all ACTUAL budget integration functionality and focuses exclusively on OFX file generation:

- ‚ùå Removed ACTUAL budget integration (`packages/export-actual/`)
- ‚ùå Removed AWS Lambda cron job (`packages/cron-aws-lambda/`)
- ‚ùå Removed ACTUAL-related environment variables
- ‚úÖ Kept core OFX generation functionality
- ‚úÖ Kept transaction filtering for Brazilian banks
- ‚úÖ Kept support for both bank accounts and credit cards

## Security

This repository is designed to be safe for public use. Here are the security measures in place:

- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data (API keys, secrets) are loaded from environment variables
- **Gitignore Protection**: The `.gitignore` file excludes all sensitive files (`.env`, `*.ofx`, etc.)
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API credentials are hardcoded in the source code
- **Example Configuration**: Use `.env.example` as a template for your local configuration

### Before Making Public

If you're planning to make this repository public, ensure:

1. ‚úÖ No `.env` files are committed
2. ‚úÖ No API keys or secrets in the code
3. ‚úÖ `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files
4. ‚úÖ Use `.env.example` for configuration template
5. ‚úÖ Review git history for any accidentally committed secrets
