# Pluggy OFX Exporter & YNAB Sync

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This was entirely vibe coded by someone untrained in computer science. Be warned.

This project allows you to export transactions from financial institutions in Brazil to OFX files, and also to synchronize them with YNAB.
It uses the free open finance API from [Pluggy](https://www.pluggy.ai/en).

## Setup

### Pre-requisites

Run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your actual Pluggy API credentials, YNAB API Key, and account configurations:
```bash
PLUGGY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
PLUGGY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
YNAB_API_KEY=your_ynab_api_key

ACCOUNT_CONFIG='[
  {
    "name": "My Checking Account",
    "pluggy_id": "pluggy_account_id_1",
    "ynab_budget_id": "ynab_budget_id_1",
    "ynab_account_id": "ynab_account_id_1"
  },
  {
    "name": "My Credit Card",
    "pluggy_id": "pluggy_account_id_2",
    "ynab_budget_id": "ynab_budget_id_2",
    "ynab_account_id": "ynab_account_id_2"
  }
]'
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive API credentials that should remain private.

## Usage

### Export transactions from Pluggy accounts to OFX files

**Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)**
```bash
pnpm run web
```
Then open http://localhost:3001 in your browser for a user-friendly interface.

**Option 2: Command Line**
```bash
pnpm run export-ofx
```

### Synchronize transactions with YNAB

Once you have configured your `.env` file with your account configurations, you can run the synchronization command:

```bash
npx tsx ./packages/export-ofx/bin/index.ts sync
```

The tool will fetch new transactions from Pluggy.ai and export them to your YNAB account based on the configurations you provided.

## Features

- ‚ùå Removed ACTUAL budget integration (`packages/export-actual/`)
- ‚ùå Removed AWS Lambda cron job (`packages/cron-aws-lambda/`)
- ‚ùå Removed ACTUAL-related environment variables
- ‚úÖ Kept core OFX generation functionality
- ‚úÖ Kept transaction filtering for Brazilian banks

## Security

This repository is designed to be safe for public use. Here are the security measures in place:

- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data (API keys, secrets) are loaded from environment variables
- **Gitignore Protection**: The `.gitignore` file excludes all sensitive files (`.env`, `*.ofx`, etc.)
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API credentials are hardcoded in the source code
- **Example Configuration**: Use `.env.example` as a template for your local configuration

### Before Making Public

If you're planning to make this repository public, ensure:

1. ‚úÖ No `.env` files are committed
2. ‚úÖ No API keys or secrets in the code
3. ‚úÖ `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files
4. ‚úÖ Use `.env.example` for configuration template
5. ‚úÖ Review git history for any accidentally committed secrets
