# Pluggy OFX Exporter

This project allows you to export transactions from financial institutions in Brazil to OFX files.
It uses the free open finance API from [Pluggy](https://www.pluggy.ai/en).

## Setup

### Pre-requisites

Run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your actual Pluggy API credentials:
```bash
PLUGGY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
PLUGGY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
PLUGGY_ITEM_IDS=item_id_1,item_id_2,item_id_3
```

> **⚠️ Security Warning**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive API credentials that should remain private.

### Export transactions from Pluggy accounts to OFX files

Run the command:
```bash
pnpm run export-ofx
```

This will export the last 3 months of transactions from each account in Pluggy to different OFX files in the `exports/` directory, organized by date.

## Features

- **OFX Export**: Export transactions to standard OFX format for use with financial software
- **Brazilian Bank Support**: Optimized for Brazilian financial institutions via Pluggy API
- **Multiple Account Types**: Support for both bank accounts and credit cards
- **Transaction Filtering**: Built-in filters for common Brazilian bank transaction patterns
- **Organized Output**: Files are automatically organized by date in the `exports/` directory

## What's Different from the Original

This fork removes all ACTUAL budget integration functionality and focuses exclusively on OFX file generation:

- ❌ Removed ACTUAL budget integration (`packages/export-actual/`)
- ❌ Removed AWS Lambda cron job (`packages/cron-aws-lambda/`)
- ❌ Removed ACTUAL-related environment variables
- ✅ Kept core OFX generation functionality
- ✅ Kept transaction filtering for Brazilian banks
- ✅ Kept support for both bank accounts and credit cards

## Security

This repository is designed to be safe for public use. Here are the security measures in place:

- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data (API keys, secrets) are loaded from environment variables
- **Gitignore Protection**: The `.gitignore` file excludes all sensitive files (`.env`, `*.ofx`, etc.)
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API credentials are hardcoded in the source code
- **Example Configuration**: Use `.env.example` as a template for your local configuration

### Before Making Public

If you're planning to make this repository public, ensure:

1. ✅ No `.env` files are committed
2. ✅ No API keys or secrets in the code
3. ✅ `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files
4. ✅ Use `.env.example` for configuration template
5. ✅ Review git history for any accidentally committed secrets
